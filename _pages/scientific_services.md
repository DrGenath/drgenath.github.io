## Organization

- **[20th ASIM Symposium on Simulation in Production and Logistics](https://www.tu-ilmenau.de/aktuelles/tagung-fuer-simulation-in-produktion-und-logistik-erfolgreich-beendet)**  
It is the largest European conference in the field of simulation in production and logistics, bringing together leading experts from science and industry every two years.
The conference took place at TU Ilmenau from September 13, 2023, to September 15, 2023, with over 150 participants. We offered four parallel tracks, two keynotes, four tutorials, one simulation award winner, 49 presentations, one welcome reception, and one networking dinner.
New technical insights were gained and discussed, particularly in the areas of sustainability and digital twins in production and logistics.
