    Simulation is an established methodology for planning and evaluating manufacturing and logistics systems. In contrast to classical simulation studies, the method of knowledge discovery in simulation data uses a simulation model as a data generator (data farming). Subsequently, hidden, previously unknown and potentially useful cause-effect relationships can be uncovered on the generated data using data mining and visual analytics methods. So far, however, there is a lack of integrated, easy-to-use software solutions for the application of the data farming in operational practice. This paper presents such an integrated solution, which allows for generating experiment designs, implements a method to distribute the necessary experiment runs, and provides the user with tools to analyze and visualize the result data.

    The traditional application of simulation in production and logistics is usually aimed at changing certain parameters in order to answer clearly defined objectives or questions. In contrast to this approach, the method of knowledge discovery in simulation data (KDS) uses a simulation model as a data generator (data farming). Subsequently using data mining methods, hidden, previously unknown and potentially useful cause-effect relationships can be uncovered. So far, however, there is a lack of guidelines and automatization-tools for non-experts or novices in KDS, which leads to a more difficult use in industrial applications and prevents a broader utilization. This paper presents a concept for automating the first step of the KDS, which is the process of characterization of the result data, using meta learning and validates it on small case study.

    The development of logistics concepts, here for supplying an automobile production with batteries, is a major challenge, especially when there are uncertainties. In order to mitigate this, the method of knowledge discovery in simulation data is to be applied here. In order to enable the planners to easily use the method, a tool that can be easily integrated into practical use (SimAssist-4farm) was developed.

    Data farming combines large-scale simulation experiments with high performance computing and
    sophisticated big data analysis methods. The portfolio of analysis methods for those large amounts of
    simulation data still yields potential to further development, and new methods emerge frequently. Among
    the most interesting are methods of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). Those methods enable the use
    of black-box-classifiers for data farming output analysis, which has been shown in a previous paper. In this
    paper, we apply the concept for XAI-based data farming analysis on a complex, real world case study to
    investigate the suitability of such concept in a real world application, and we also elaborate on which blackbox
    classifiers are actually the most suitable for large-scale simulation data that accumulates in a data
    farming project.

    Hybrid modeling and simulation studies combine well-defined methods from other disciplines with a
    simulation technique. Especially in the area of output data analysis of simulation studies, there is great
    potential for hybrid approaches that incorporate methods from machine learning and AI. For their successful
    application, the analytical capabilities of machine learning and AI must be combined with the interpretive
    capabilities of humans. In most cases, this connection is achieved through visualizations. As methods
    become more complicated, the demands on visualizations are increasing. In this paper, we conduct a data
    farming study and delve into the analysis of the output data. In doing so, we uncover typical errors in
    visualizations making the interpretation and evaluation of the data difficult or misleading. We then apply
    concepts of visual analytics to these visualizations and derive general guidelines to help simulation users
    to analyze their simulation studies and present results unambiguously and clearly.

    Effective and efficient university programming education increasingly requires
    the use of automated assessment systems. As part of the examING2 project, the
    AutoPING subproject is testing the use of the open-source autograding system CodeOcean for comprehensive
    courses and exams at the Technical University of Ilmenau with the aim of enabling and promoting self-directed and
    competence-oriented learning. This article provides an overview of
    initial project experiences in adapting didactic scenarios in programming education to
    test-driven software development and the generation of feedback. It discusses key
    findings from the perspective of students and teachers, challenges and approaches to
    integrating and expanding CodeOcean for new fields of application, and

    The examING project – digitization of competency-based testing for bachelor's degree programs in engineering – 
    is investigating how feedback on programming tasks can be improved through generative AI. 
    The aim is to make feedback more individualized, differentiated, constructive, and linguistically variable. 
    The approach developed motivates learners through practical tasks, extensive practice opportunities, 
    and integrated programming tools. To implement this, ChatGPT was integrated into the web-based autograder system CodeOcean via an API. 
    Structured prompts are used to generate factual feedback that specifically addresses the submitted solutions. 
    Initial results show that AI integration can be used to generate high-quality, customizable feedback along defined dimensions. 
    The next steps include the user-friendly presentation of feedback, an evaluation of acceptance, 
    and expansion to other use cases such as comment requests, note creation, and task clarification. 
    The project is funded by the Foundation for Innovation in Higher Education as part of the federal-state program “Strengthening Universities through Digitization.”

    As part of the redesign of a course on operational digitization, the desire was expressed to also digitize teaching itself to a greater extent. 
    The aim is to give students a basic understanding of programming so that they can better understand digital possibilities. 
    The autograder CodeOcean was used as a suitable tool—a web-based open-source platform with a development environment, 
    collaboration functions, and LMS integration. 
    In the “examING” project, funded by the Foundation for Innovation in Higher Education, 
    new digital teaching and examination formats for Python training were developed and tested with CodeOcean. 
    So far, around 270 students have participated in the courses, and around 120 have taken digital exams. 
    Feedback and observations accompanied the implementation. 
    Automated assessment by CodeOcean facilitates individual learning and promotes targeted skills development. 
    The article reflects on the experiences, identifies challenges, and outlines further developments, 
    in particular the planned integration of generative AI such as ChatGPT to further improve feedback for students.
