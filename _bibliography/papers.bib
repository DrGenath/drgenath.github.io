    There is a growing demand for future-oriented skills in engineering education. This paper explores implementation and use of the
    CodeOcean autograding system in a Python programming course for first-semester students at a university. Based on the
    framework of constructive alignment, the course integrates automated formative and summative assessments to promote
    programming and digital skills. While working on iterative semester-long exercises, students receive continuous feedback from
    the autograder to support self-organized digital learning. Survey results and experiences gained over several semesters show
    challenges of implementing effective automatic feedback, namely quality and conciseness. They also help identify advantages such
    as scalability, efficiency, and learning outcomes. This paper concludes with practical insights and outlines possible improvements,
    including the integration of AI-based feedback to further increase learning effectiveness.

  abstract = 	{The main objective of an engineering degree is to develop the necessary professional, methodological and social skills of engineering students. In this context, university graduates are particularly characterized by the fact that they have a broad range of professional and methodological knowledge and, at the same time, scientific problem-solving skills. These enable them to face new challenges by critically analyzing emerging issues and expanding their knowledge throughout their lives. They can apply their knowledge in a targeted manner. Engineers have to solve complex technical problems and develop demand-driven solutions for different markets considering various time, regulatory, and financial constraints. They must cope with an ever-changing world and adapt to rapidly changing technological and social conditions. Therefore, engineering education should be based on frameworks such as Future Skills and 21st Century Skills to ensure clarity in the development of skills and the sustainability of programs. There is a growing emphasis on teaching not only technical expertise, but also key skills for long-term career success. Launched in 2021, the examING project aims to explore and evaluate skills-based learning and examination in undergraduate engineering programs. It includes several sub-projects focused on Digital Collaboration, Digital Learning and Digital Literacy. Guided by the principles of Constructive Alignment, the project is revising learning outcomes, defining learning activities, and developing examinations to ensure that students acquire and apply relevant skills for future engineering challenges.},

    As part of the redesign of a course on operational digitization, the desire was expressed to also digitize teaching itself to a greater extent. 
    The aim is to give students a basic understanding of programming so that they can better understand digital possibilities. 
    The autograder CodeOcean was used as a suitable tool—a web-based open-source platform with a development environment, 
    collaboration functions, and LMS integration. 
    In the “examING” project, funded by the Foundation for Innovation in Higher Education, 
    new digital teaching and examination formats for Python training were developed and tested with CodeOcean. 
    So far, around 270 students have participated in the courses, and around 120 have taken digital exams. 
    Feedback and observations accompanied the implementation. 
    Automated assessment by CodeOcean facilitates individual learning and promotes targeted skills development. 
    The article reflects on the experiences, identifies challenges, and outlines further developments, 
    in particular the planned integration of generative AI such as ChatGPT to further improve feedback for students.

    The examING project – digitization of competency-based testing for bachelor's degree programs in engineering – 
    is investigating how feedback on programming tasks can be improved through generative AI. 
    The aim is to make feedback more individualized, differentiated, constructive, and linguistically variable. 
    The approach developed motivates learners through practical tasks, extensive practice opportunities, 
    and integrated programming tools. To implement this, ChatGPT was integrated into the web-based autograder system CodeOcean via an API. 
    Structured prompts are used to generate factual feedback that specifically addresses the submitted solutions. 
    Initial results show that AI integration can be used to generate high-quality, customizable feedback along defined dimensions. 
    The next steps include the user-friendly presentation of feedback, an evaluation of acceptance, 
    and expansion to other use cases such as comment requests, note creation, and task clarification. 
    The project is funded by the Foundation for Innovation in Higher Education as part of the federal-state program “Strengthening Universities through Digitization.”

    Hybrid modeling and simulation studies combine well-defined methods from other disciplines with a
    simulation technique. Especially in the area of output data analysis of simulation studies, there is great
    potential for hybrid approaches that incorporate methods from machine learning and AI. For their successful
    application, the analytical capabilities of machine learning and AI must be combined with the interpretive
    capabilities of humans. In most cases, this connection is achieved through visualizations. As methods
    become more complicated, the demands on visualizations are increasing. In this paper, we conduct a data
    farming study and delve into the analysis of the output data. In doing so, we uncover typical errors in
    visualizations making the interpretation and evaluation of the data difficult or misleading. We then apply
    concepts of visual analytics to these visualizations and derive general guidelines to help simulation users
    to analyze their simulation studies and present results unambiguously and clearly.

    Data farming combines large-scale simulation experiments with high performance computing and
    sophisticated big data analysis methods. The portfolio of analysis methods for those large amounts of
    simulation data still yields potential to further development, and new methods emerge frequently. Among
    the most interesting are methods of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). Those methods enable the use
    of black-box-classifiers for data farming output analysis, which has been shown in a previous paper. In this
    paper, we apply the concept for XAI-based data farming analysis on a complex, real world case study to
    investigate the suitability of such concept in a real world application, and we also elaborate on which blackbox
    classifiers are actually the most suitable for large-scale simulation data that accumulates in a data
    farming project.

    The traditional application of simulation in production and logistics is usually aimed at changing certain parameters in order to answer clearly defined objectives or questions. In contrast to this approach, the method of knowledge discovery in simulation data (KDS) uses a simulation model as a data generator (data farming). Subsequently using data mining methods, hidden, previously unknown and potentially useful cause-effect relationships can be uncovered. So far, however, there is a lack of guidelines and automatization-tools for non-experts or novices in KDS, which leads to a more difficult use in industrial applications and prevents a broader utilization. This paper presents a concept for automating the first step of the KDS, which is the process of characterization of the result data, using meta learning and validates it on small case study.
