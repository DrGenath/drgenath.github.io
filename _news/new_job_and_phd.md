I've started a new job and my PhD!

Exciting news! A new adventure awaits as I embark on the next thrilling chapter of my career.
I've just started my first full-time job, and I'm also beginning my journey towards a PhD at the TU Ilmenau within the Group for Information Technology in Production and Logistics.

I'm really looking forward to getting stuck into the research.

If you're interested in any of these areas, I'd love to hear from you! I'm always open to friendly chats, collaborations, and working together.
